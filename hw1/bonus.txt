Visualization:
- If a text file `project-config.txt` is present, setting `VISUALIZATION = true` in it will write an ASCII text visualization of the house to a file named `visualization.txt`
- The visualization shows the movement of the vacuum cleaner in the house, as well as its location, and the location of the docking station
- Vacuum cleaner is denoted by `V`
- Docking station is denoted by `D`
- Every cell in the table not `V` and `D` shows the dirt level on it
- Walls are also indicated between cells
- This feature was implemented in `DevTools.h`, `DevTools.cpp` and in `House.cpp` (house constructor in line 109 and in `updateVisualization()` method)
- Example `visualization.txt` file provided shows it fully running on `input_c.txt`, the 6x7 house described in the README.md / HDL.

Documentation HTML file:
- We generated a HTML file using Doxygen for better documentation of the classes.
- The documentation includes useful collaboration graphs for understanding the class relationships (inheritance, containment, etc.)
- Re-generation of this documentation can be done using the `Doxyfile` configuration file provided, with `doxygen` installed and calling `doxygen Doxyfile`.
- Opening the HTML file in the browser can be done using: `open html/index.html`
